GitHub exercises for UMGC Software Development Certificate
Project/Assessment/Exercise Submission Guidelines

Effective Immediately

Please note a change in our submission process:
From now on, all submissions should be hosted on GitHub.

Projects and Capstone Projects: Please create public repositories for these.

Assessments: Please create private repositories for these.
Exercises: You may create either public or private repositories.

Important Considerations:
Public Repositories: If you decide to make your exercise repositories public, please be aware that they will be publicly accessible. Consider deleting these repositories at the end of the course.
Private Repositories: If you choose to make your exercise repositories private, please add your mentors as collaborators to your repository.

Submission Instructions:

Create a GitHub Repository:
Choose an appropriate repository name.
Initialize the repository with a README file.
Add your project/assessment/exercise files to the repository.

Push Your Repository to GitHub:
Use Git commands to push your local repository to your remote GitHub repository.

Submit the GitHub Repository Link:
Submit the link to your GitHub repository on the appropriate platform (e.g., Canvas, Google Classroom).

Additional Tips:
Utilize GitHub's features like issues, pull requests, and branches to manage your projects effectively.
Please consider using a .gitignore file to avoid unnecessary files from being uploaded to your repository.
Please write clear and concise commit messages to track changes in your code.
